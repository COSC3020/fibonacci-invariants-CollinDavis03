# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.


Answer: 
Invariant Definition: 
It is something that must hold true throughout the code to ensure it is running correctly. 

Answer: 
A good invariant for the recursive Fibonacci sequence from arr[0....(arr.length - 1)]. These are defined by the sum of the last two elements in the array and the first two elements are [0,1] are always true. 

Sources: 
I looked at Nolan's repo after I wrote my statement explaining the invariants. I added the to clarify after just to make sure I touched everything. I also watched a YouTube video a while back on the C++ Fibonacci function and I took the logic from it and wrote it into javascript. Other than that I have not used anything else. I can not find the exact video I watched to put the link in here. Talked to Lars after class about it. I hope I did it right and if it is wrong I will talk to TA tomorrow.

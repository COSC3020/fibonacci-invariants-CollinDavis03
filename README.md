# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.


Answer: 
A good invariant for this would be an array that can hold all the numbers within the sequence. I used the (arr[i-1] + arr[i-2]). The reason I chose this is because it will always be able to hold to elements from the array until I can get the third element. This is always in the same sequence with each iteration until it is stopped or hits the limit. Especially starting with an array [0,1] it should remain true. This will ensure that at the beginning of each iteration, we have the necessary elements to compute the next one. 

To clarify what I am saying above. The index = i and we expect the previous to elements from arr[i-1] and arr[i-2] to be the correct Fibonacci numbers.

I looked at Nolan's repo after I wrote my statement explaning the invariants. I added the to clarify after just to make sure I touched everything. I also watched a YouTube video a while back on the C++ Fibonacci function and I took the logic from it and wrote it into javascript. Other than that I have not used anything else. I can not find the exact video I watched to put the link in here.
